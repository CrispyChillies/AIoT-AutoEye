# Image Processor Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### Files Removed

- ❌ `backend/image_processor.py` - Complete file removed

### Files Modified

- ✅ `backend/mqtt_handler.py` - Updated to remove image processing dependencies

## What Was Changed

### MQTT Handler (`backend/mqtt_handler.py`)

1. **Removed Import**: Removed `from image_processor import TrafficImageProcessor`
2. **Removed Instance**: Removed `self.image_processor = TrafficImageProcessor()` from `__init__`
3. **Added Vehicle Counting**: Added `count_vehicles()` method directly to MQTTHandler class
4. **Updated Processing Logic**:
   - Removed image processing pipeline
   - Now stores raw images directly for frontend processing
   - Keeps bbox data intact for frontend to draw bounding boxes
   - Maintains vehicle counting functionality

### Data Structure Changes

- **Before**: Stored processed images with bounding boxes drawn by backend
- **After**: Stores raw images + bbox data for frontend processing

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend handles UI/visualization, backend handles data processing
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed OpenCV, PIL, numpy dependencies from backend
3. **Better Performance**: Backend doesn't need to process images
4. **Flexibility**: Frontend can implement custom visualization styles
5. **Maintainability**: Cleaner backend code focused on data handling

## What Still Works

✅ **MQTT Handler**: Receives data from edge devices  
✅ **Vehicle Counting**: Counts cars, motorbikes, and lane traffic  
✅ **Database Storage**: Saves traffic data including raw images and bbox data  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All routes work normally  
✅ **Flask Application**: Starts and runs without errors

## Frontend Integration

The frontend now receives:

- `image`: Base64 encoded raw image
- `bbox_data`: Array of bounding box objects with coordinates and classifications
- Vehicle counts and traffic statistics

Frontend should:

1. Decode the base64 image
2. Draw bounding boxes using the bbox_data
3. Display vehicle counts and statistics
